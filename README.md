# SSCut

A simple web based/desktop runable video cutter in which you can cut by second what you want from a video. 

**It's really bad, better just use CapCut.**

## Run App
- make dev (with reload using air go binary);
- make run (no reload just go run main.go);

## Run SvelteUI
- cd ui;
- npm run dev;

## Make binaries
- make build;

## Run binary on Windows
- double click the executable SSCutWin.exe;
- ./SSCutWin.exe from the terminal;

## Run binary on Mac/Linux
- ./SSCutMac from the terminal;
- ./SSCutLinux from the terminal;

## Some issues:
- Port already in use - if possible do `sudo fuser -k 3000/tcp` (ubuntu, search how to kill running process at port for your os);


**Again. It's really bad, better just use CapCut.**
